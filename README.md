# Camel-Banana-Puzzle
The Solution:
To maximize the number of bananas the traveler can transport, they can follow these steps:

Fill the sack of bananas with 1000 bananas.
Start traveling towards the destination.
After traveling 1 mile, the camel will have consumed 1 banana, so there will be 999 bananas left in the sack.
At this point, the traveler can unload the 999 bananas and return to the starting point.
The traveler repeats the process, filling the sack again with 1000 bananas and traveling 1 mile.
Again, after traveling 1 mile, the camel will have consumed 1 banana, leaving 999 bananas in the sack.
The traveler unloads the 999 bananas and returns to the starting point.
The traveler continues this process until they reach the destination.
